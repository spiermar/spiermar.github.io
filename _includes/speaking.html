          <h3>I Speak At Events</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Over the last few years, I've given inumerous presentations, to groups as small as six and as large as 6,000. Most of my talks are technical and related to the work I've been doing at Netflix. I'm also known to seldomly speak on topics related to innovation, technology, engineering leadership, culture, product development, and the Silicon Valley mindset.</p>
          <p>Besides public presentations, I also talk with companies and individual teams, locally in the Bay Area and remotely, about a varied set of subjects.</p>
          <p>I tailor each session to the audience and strive to create the outcome you want to create!</p>
          <p>If you're interested in a speaking engagement or meeting, scroll to the <a href="#contact">contact area</a> to get in touch with me, and include the event date, location and your expectations in the message.</p>
