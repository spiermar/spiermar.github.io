Here you can find a few projects I'm currently involved with, in one way or another.

# Mongol Rally

In 2015 I completed the [Mongol Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally/), driving over 12.000 miles, across 21 countries, over 2 months, for charity. It was one of the most amazing adventures I experienced so far, and hopefully, the start of something incredible! I'm still going over all the pictures and working on what will soon be a great series of posts on Medium. Follow the details on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yakinaroundteam/) and our page, [yakinaround.com](http://yakinaround.com/).

# Rickshaw Run

# Vector

Vector is an open source on-host performance monitoring framework which exposes hand picked high resolution system and application metrics to every engineerâ€™s browser. Having the right metrics available on-demand and at a high resolution is key to understand how a system behaves and correctly troubleshoot performance issues.

# overloaded.io

I seldom blog about performance and related subjects @ [overloaded.io](http://overloaded.io). If you have a technical question or something that might interest other people too, share the love and post a comment! There's even a section called [Ask Me Anything!](http://overloaded.io/ask-me-anything).

# Mikrogramm

I love electronic music. Time is lacking, but whenever possible, I try to record something new and fresh at my home studio. If it's not complete *rubbish*, it goes to SoundCloud.
