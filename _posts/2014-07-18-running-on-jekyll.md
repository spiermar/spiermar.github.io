title: Running on Jekyll
---

For a long time I've been trying to find a good project to try a static blog generator, like Octopress and Jekyll. Altough I'm not ready to move [overloaded.io](http://overloaded.io/) yet, for a long time I've been thinking about writing a personal blog again and this is a great opportunity for it!

The simple fact that I don't need a server with tons PHP processes eating huge amounts of memory and a MySQL instance just to store a few megabytes of text is a huge advantage. I can run this site on anything! To simplify things even more, GitHub provides hosting for static websites. Just create a repo, commit your changes and it's up. Fast, simple and under version control, which is more than I can say for most PHP websites around.

I'm also a big fan of Markdown. Why bother with fancy WYSIWYG editors, that can be painfully slow sometimes, when I can simply use any text editor to have a nicely formatted and clean page.

Writing is already a task that requires a huge amount of motivation on my side, so any small improvement that can make this easier, can hopefully make me more productive at it too! Let's see if I keep the commits coming!
