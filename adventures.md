I love to travel, adventure, not tourism. Getting to know new places, new cultures and new people are the most fulfilling things one can experience in life. Iâ€™ll jump into a plane or back of a truck at the smallest opportunity. Overlanding, backpacking and adventure traveling are the best ways of getting to know new places, not in 5-star hotels and guided tours!

> According to TripAdvisor, I visited north of 40 countries, hundreds of places, and that's less than 20% of of the world!

## Llama Run

Earlier in 2018, me and a few frieds decided to drive old VW Bugs from South Brazil to Peru! We lost a car (and a participant) on the way, but we managed to visit Iguazu Falls, cross the Andes, the Atacama desert, drove into Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, went to Lake Titicaca and Machu Picchu, and arrived in Cusco to complete our month-long adventure. Check the journey on [PolarSteps](https://www.polarsteps.com/MartinSpier/673967-llama-run?s=A03F0547-E0E4-48C0-AE1A-27849DDA3991), or the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/604303013248626/) for more details.

## Rickshaw Run

In 2017, I participated in the [Rickshaw Run](http://www.theadventurists.com/rickshaw-run/), driving a [tuk tuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw) in India, top to bottom, from Rajasthan to Kerala. Over 3.000 km, with a max speed of 30 km/h, going downhill.

## Mongol Rally

In 2015 I completed the [Mongol Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally/), driving over 12.000 miles, across 21 countries, over 2 months, for charity. It was one of the most amazing adventures I experienced so far, and hopefully, the start of something incredible! I'm still going over all the pictures and working on what will soon be a great series of posts on Medium.
