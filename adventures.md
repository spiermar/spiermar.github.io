# 2015 Mongol Rally

In 2015 I completed the [Mongol Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally/), driving over 12.000 miles, across 21 countries, over 2 months, for charity. It was one of the most amazing adventures I experienced so far, and hopefully, the start of something incredible! I'm still going over all the pictures and working on what will soon be a great series of posts on Medium. Follow the details on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yakaround/) and our page, [yakinaround.com](http://yakinaround.com/).
