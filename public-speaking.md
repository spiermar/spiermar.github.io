Over the last few years, I've given inumerous presentations, to groups as small as six and as large as 6,000. Most of my talks are technical and related to the work I've been doing at Netflix. I'm also known to seldomly speak on topics related to innovation, technology, leadership, product development, and the Silicon Valley culture. 

I tailor each presentation to the audience and strive to create the outcome you want to create.

If you're interested in a speaking engagement, please check the [contact page](/contact) for contact details. Also, please include the event date, location and your expectations in the message.
