> Performance Engineer @ Netflix. Advisor @ monashees+. Entrepreneur. Adventurer. Maker. Addicted to Travel and Electronic Music.

It’s short, but pretty self-descriptive. I’m an engineer, more specifically, a performance engineer @ Netflix, the world's leading internet-based television network and largest single source of internet traffic in North America. I try to fill my days trying to make Netflix as fast, efficient and resilient as possible, from your iPhone client to the operating system powering all our backend services.

I love travel, not tourism. Getting to know new places, new cultures and new people are the most fulfilling things one can experience in life. I’ll jump into a plane or back of a truck at the smallest opportunity. In 2015 I finished the [Mongol Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally/), driving over 12.000 miles, across 21 countries, over 2 months, for charity. Finished the [Rickshaw Run](http://www.theadventurists.com/rickshaw-run/) in 2017, driving a [tuk tuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw) in India, top to bottom. Over 3.000 km, with a max speed of 30 km/h, downhill. Starting a new adventure in 2018, driving old VW Bugs from South Brazil to Peru! Follow this new adventure on our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/604303013248626/). I'm a big proponent of backpacking, overland and adventure traveling. The best way of getting to know new places is not in a 5-star hotel!

According to TripAdvisor, I visited north of 40 countries, hundreds of places, and that's less than 20% of of the world!
