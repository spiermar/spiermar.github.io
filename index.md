> I was once told I was a "man of many passions".

A while ago, I had to come up with the famous 160 character “about me”. This is what I got:

> Performance Engineer @ Netflix. CTO @ HandsOn.TV. Founder of MyAdventure. Entrepreneur. Investor. Addicted to Travel and Electronic Music.

It’s short, but pretty self-descriptive. I’m an engineer, more specifically, a performance engineer @ Netflix, the biggest streaming service in the world and largest single source of internet traffic in North America. I try to fill my days developing new tools and improving the overall performance stability of the service, from the user device to the last service tier.

I'm the co-founder and CTO of HandsOn.TV, a global video platform to discover, learn & share carefully curated entrepreneurship-minded content. We believe that the entrepreneurial mindset can change the world for better and video is the best format to spread it!

MyAdventure is a place to share your adventures with the world, from your weekend trip to Yosemite, to your 12-month overland adventure in Africa. We know that every detail of your adventure can inspire and help others to do the same. That's why MyAdventure provides a platform for you to share everything, integrating satellite trackers, social networks, interactive maps with an easy-to-use mobile app that works anywhere, even without internet access!

I'm passionate about travel. Getting to know new places, new cultures and new people is one of the most fulfilling you can do. I’ll jump into a plane or back of a truck at the smallest opportunity. In 2015 I completed the [Mongol Rally](http://yakinaround.com/), driving over 12.000 miles, across 21 countries, over 2 months, for charity. I'm a big proponent of backpacking, overland and adventure traveling. The best way of getting to know new places is not in a 5-star hotel! According to TripAdvisor, I visited north of 30 countries, hundreds of places, and that's just 17% of of the world!
