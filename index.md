> Performance Engineer @ Netflix. Advisor @ monashees+. Entrepreneur. Adventurer. Addicted to Travel and Electronic Music.

Hi folks. I’m Martin. I’m an engineer, more specifically, a performance engineer @ Netflix, the world's leading entertainment service and largest single source of internet traffic in North America. I try to fill my days trying to make Netflix as fast, efficient and resilient as possible, from your iPhone client to the operating system powering all our backend services.

I've developed multiple open source tools like [Vector](https://github.com/Netflix/vector) and [FlameScope](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope), created plugins like [d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-grap) and [d3-heatmap2](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-heatmap2), and contributed inumerous other projects.

Internally at Netflix, I've created Icarus, Netflix's real-user performance monitoring solution that runs on every single Netflix device on the planet. Developed Mogul, a bottleneck analysis tool that inspects internal and external dependency demand for services and help us identify bottlenecks and tuning opportunities. Developed Slalom, a high-level demand analysis tool that helps visualize demand flow on large scale systems. Worked on metric trending that helps us identify long-term performance regressions. Developed the in-house cloud performance testing framework, analysis tool and fully automated analysis engine for performance tests. 

I'm also a Venture Advisor at [monashees+](http://monashees.com.br/en/), one of the largest venture capital firms in Brazil, where I try to understand the tech level of prospective startups and help the invested ones to grow! Besides the portfolio startups, I advise multiple companies, of all sizes and shapes, on a varied set of challenges.
