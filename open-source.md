Here you can find a few open-source projects I'm currently involved with, in one way or another.

## vector

Vector is an open source on-host performance monitoring framework which exposes hand picked high resolution system and application metrics to every engineerâ€™s browser. Having the right metrics available on-demand and at a high resolution is key to understand how a system behaves and correctly troubleshoot performance issues.

## flamescome

FlameScope is a visualization tool for exploring different time ranges as Flame Graphs, allowing quick analysis of performance issues such as perturbations, variance, single-threaded execution, and more.

FlameScope begins by displaying the input data as an interactive subsecond-offset heat map. This shows patterns in the data. You can then select a time range to highlight on different patterns, and a flame graph will be generated just for that time range.

## d3-flame-graph

A D3.js plugin that produces flame graphs from hierarchical data. Flame graphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately.

## burn

burn ðŸ”¥ is a CLI tool to convert performance profiles (perf_events, pprof, etc) to hierarchical data structure that can be visualized as flame graphs, with the help of the [d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph) plugin. burn ðŸ”¥ can also generate a self contained html flame graphs from the same data.
