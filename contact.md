# Email

That's probably the easiest way to get in touch. Unless I'm out traveling to some exotic island with no internet connection, chances are that I'll get back to you shortly. I like to keep a clean inbox!

Currently you can reach me at [spiermar@gmail.com](mailto:spiermar@gmail.com).

# LinkedIn

If you want to connect, I'm on LinkedIn too! Always keen on expanding my network. Just make an effort and at least write a message mentioning why you'd like to connect.

Here is a link to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinspier).

# Twitter

Follow me! I try not to overshare, but usually if I find something cool online, Twitter is where it's going. [@spiermar](https://twitter.com/spiermar).

# SlideShare

I'm often invited to speak at conferences and events. I try to make my slides available on SlideShare.
