# Email

Easiest way to get in touch. Enless I'm out traveling to some exotic island with no internet access, chances are that I'll get back to you shortly. I like to keep a clean inbox!

# LinkedIn

Always keen on connecting and expanding my network. Just make an effort and try to write a message mentioning how you know me or why you would like to connect.
